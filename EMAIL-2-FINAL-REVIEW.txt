EMAIL 2 SCENARIO - FINAL REVIEW
================================================================================

CURRENT STATUS: ✅ 95% Perfect - Minor Issues to Check
================================================================================

✅ WHAT'S WORKING CORRECTLY:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ✅ Date Filter
   - Using: {{addHours(now; -1)}} (1 hour - perfect for testing!)
   - Operator: time:less ✅
   - This will find leads who got Email 1 at least 1 hour ago

2. ✅ Status Filter
   - Filter: Status (E) = "Email 1 Sent" ✅

3. ✅ Router Structure
   - Route 1: English emails ✅
   - Route 2: Arabic emails ✅

4. ✅ English Email (Module 3)
   - Subject: "Reminder: Don't Miss UAE Property Expo – Muscat" ✅
   - HTML template correct ✅
   - Image: https://i.imgur.com/9GWYlQI.jpeg ✅
   - Filter: Language = "en" ✅

5. ✅ Arabic Email (Module 4)
   - Subject: "تذكير: لا تفوت معرض عقارات الإمارات – مسقط" ✅ (FIXED!)
   - HTML template correct ✅
   - Image: https://i.imgur.com/r0drplC.jpeg ✅
   - Filter: Language = "ar" ✅

6. ✅ Google Sheets Updates
   - Both routes update Status to "Email 2 Sent" ✅
   - Both routes update Email 2 Date (H) with {{now}} ✅

================================================================================
⚠️ POTENTIAL ISSUES TO CHECK:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE 1: Email Mapping with Backticks
---------------------------------------
Your email modules use: {{1.`1`}} and {{1.`3`}}

The backticks might cause issues. Try:
- {{1.1}} instead of {{1.`1`}}
- {{1.3}} instead of {{1.`3`}}

However, if it's working, keep it as is!

ISSUE 2: Router vs Module Filters
-----------------------------------
You have filters on the EMAIL MODULES (Module 3 and Module 4), not on the Router.

This is actually fine! It works the same way:
- Router routes to both paths
- Each email module has its own filter
- Only matching emails send

But typically, filters are on the Router routes, not individual modules.
If it works, it's fine!

================================================================================
TESTING YOUR SCENARIO
================================================================================

With your existing lead (Fahad Alamri):
- Language: "ar" ✅
- Status: "Email 1 Sent" ✅
- Email 1 Date: 2025-11-24T12:47:31.395Z (Nov 24)

Since you're using {{addHours(now; -1)}}, the filter will find:
- Leads where Email 1 Date is older than 1 hour ago

If Email 1 was sent on Nov 24 and today is later, it should work!

RUN THE TEST:
-------------
1. Run "Email 2 - Reminder" scenario manually
2. It should find Fahad Alamri's lead
3. Route to Arabic email (Language = "ar")
4. Send Email 2 to: chairman@falconeyegroup.net
5. Update Google Sheets: Status = "Email 2 Sent"

================================================================================
AFTER TESTING - RESTORE PRODUCTION SETTINGS
================================================================================

Once Email 2 works correctly:

1. Change date filter back to: {{addDays(now; -3)}}
2. Add Schedule trigger: Run daily at 9:00 AM
3. Test one more time with the 3-day filter
4. Then it's ready for production!

================================================================================
NEXT: CREATE EMAIL 3 SCENARIO
================================================================================

After Email 2 is tested and working:

1. Create "Email 3 - Final Call" scenario
2. Use same structure as Email 2
3. Filter: Status = "Email 2 Sent"
4. Filter: Email 2 Date < {{addDays(now; -4)}}
5. Add English and Arabic email modules
6. Update Status to "Campaign Complete"

================================================================================
YOUR SCENARIO IS READY TO TEST!
================================================================================

Everything looks correct:
✅ Filters are set up
✅ Both language routes configured
✅ Email templates correct
✅ Google Sheets updates correct
✅ Arabic subject is now in Arabic ✅

Just run it and see if it works! 🚀
