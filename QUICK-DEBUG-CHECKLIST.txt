QUICK DEBUG CHECKLIST
5-Minute Check
================================================================================

Run through this checklist quickly:

□ 1. Scenario is ON (green button in Make.com)
□ 2. Latest execution shows Module 1 ran (check execution history)
□ 3. Module 8 variables have values (check execution log for Module 8)
□ 4. Module 3 "To" field = {{8.email}} (not "8. email")
□ 5. Module 4 "To" field = {{8.email}} (not "8. email")
□ 6. Module 8 has no backticks: {{1.1}} not {{1.`1`}}
□ 7. Router has filters: {{8.language}} = "en" and "ar"
□ 8. Test lead in Google Sheets has valid email and language

IF ALL CHECKED:
---------------
→ Check execution logs for error messages
→ Tell me which module failed and what error it shows

================================================================================
MOST COMMON ISSUE
================================================================================

90% of the time, it's one of these:

1. "To" field still shows "8. email" instead of {{8.email}}
   → Fix: Change "value" field to {{8.email}}

2. Module 8 has backticks: {{1.`1`}}
   → Fix: Remove backticks: {{1.1}}

3. Router has no filters
   → Fix: Add filters to both routes

4. Scenario is OFF
   → Fix: Turn it ON

================================================================================
TELL ME THIS:
================================================================================

1. Open execution history
2. Click latest execution
3. Which module is RED (failed)?
4. What error message does it show?
5. Copy the exact error message

This will tell us exactly what's wrong!
