DEBUG: Filter Finding 0 Rows
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
--------
Google Sheets Filter Rows returned: __IMTLENGTH__: 0
This means NO leads matched your filter criteria.

Your filters:
1. Status (E) = "Email 1 Sent"
2. Email 1 Date (G) < {{addHours(now; -1)}}

================================================================================
POSSIBLE CAUSES
================================================================================

CAUSE 1: Date Comparison Issue
-------------------------------
The date filter might not be working correctly.

Your lead has:
- Email 1 Date: 2025-11-24T12:47:31.395Z (Nov 24, 2025)

If today is Nov 24, 2025 and it's been more than 1 hour since 12:47 PM, it should match.
But if the date comparison isn't working, it won't.

SOLUTION:
1. Check what the current date/time is
2. Verify Email 1 Date is actually older than 1 hour
3. Try using a longer delay: {{addHours(now; -24)}} (24 hours)

CAUSE 2: Status Value Mismatch
-------------------------------
The Status column might have a different value than "Email 1 Sent"

Check:
- Is it exactly "Email 1 Sent" (case-sensitive)?
- No extra spaces?
- No different wording?

SOLUTION:
1. Open Google Sheets
2. Check the exact value in Status column (E)
3. Make sure it matches exactly: "Email 1 Sent"

CAUSE 3: Date Format Issue
--------------------------
The date format in Google Sheets might not match what Make.com expects.

SOLUTION:
1. Check the Email 1 Date format in Google Sheets
2. Make sure it's a proper date/time format
3. Try changing dateTimeRenderOption to "SERIAL_NUMBER"

CAUSE 4: Filter Logic Issue
---------------------------
The "time:less" operator might need to be "date:less" or vice versa.

SOLUTION:
Try changing the operator:
- From: "time:less"
- To: "date:less" or "date:lessThanOrEqual"

================================================================================
QUICK FIXES TO TRY
================================================================================

FIX 1: Remove Date Filter Temporarily
--------------------------------------
Test with ONLY the Status filter:

Filter 1: Status (E) = "Email 1 Sent"
(Remove Filter 2 temporarily)

If this finds rows, the date filter is the problem.

FIX 2: Use Longer Time Window
------------------------------
Change from 1 hour to 24 hours:

"b": "{{addHours(now; -24)}}"

This gives a bigger window and is more likely to match.

FIX 3: Check Actual Date Values
---------------------------------
1. Add a Set Variable module after the filter
2. Store: {{1.6}} (Email 1 Date column)
3. Run scenario and check what value is stored
4. Compare with current date/time

FIX 4: Simplify Date Filter
---------------------------
Instead of comparing dates, try:
- Filter: Email 1 Date is not empty
- Then add date check in a later module

================================================================================
STEP-BY-STEP DEBUGGING
================================================================================

STEP 1: Test Status Filter Only
--------------------------------
1. Remove the date filter (Filter 2)
2. Keep only: Status (E) = "Email 1 Sent"
3. Run scenario
4. Check if it finds your lead

If YES → Date filter is the problem
If NO → Status filter is the problem

STEP 2: Test Date Filter Only
-------------------------------
1. Remove Status filter (Filter 1)
2. Keep only: Email 1 Date (G) < {{addHours(now; -1)}}
3. Run scenario
4. Check if it finds your lead

If YES → Status filter is the problem
If NO → Date filter is the problem

STEP 3: Check Actual Values
----------------------------
1. Add Set Variable module after filter
2. Variables:
   - testStatus = {{1.4}}
   - testEmail1Date = {{1.6}}
3. Run scenario
4. Check execution log to see actual values

STEP 4: Adjust Based on Results
-------------------------------
- If Status doesn't match: Fix the value in Google Sheets
- If Date doesn't match: Adjust the date filter or use longer window

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED QUICK FIX
================================================================================

Try this filter configuration:

Filter 1: Status (E) = "Email 1 Sent"
Filter 2: Email 1 Date (G) < {{addHours(now; -24)}}

This uses 24 hours instead of 1 hour, which is more likely to match.

OR

Remove the date filter entirely for testing:
- Just use: Status (E) = "Email 1 Sent"
- This will find ALL leads with that status
- You can add date filtering later

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE: Use Different Filter Approach
================================================================================

Instead of filtering in Google Sheets, you can:

1. Get ALL rows with Status = "Email 1 Sent"
2. Add a Filter module after Google Sheets
3. Filter by date there (more control)

This gives you better debugging options.

================================================================================
CHECK YOUR LEAD DATA
================================================================================

Verify in Google Sheets:
- Row for Fahad Alamri
- Column E (Status): Should be exactly "Email 1 Sent"
- Column G (Email 1 Date): Should be a valid date/time
- Make sure there are no extra spaces or formatting issues
