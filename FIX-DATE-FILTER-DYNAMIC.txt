FIX: Date Filter Using Hardcoded Date
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
--------
Your filter is using a hardcoded date:
"2025-11-21T12:16:21.072Z"

This means it will ONLY find leads where Email 1 Date is after Nov 21, 2025.
After that date passes, the filter won't work anymore!

SOLUTION:
---------
Use a dynamic date calculation that always calculates "3 days ago" from today.

================================================================================
CORRECT FILTER CONFIGURATION
================================================================================

Filter 1: Status (E) = "Email 1 Sent" ✅
Filter 2: Email 1 Date (G) > {{addDays(now; -3)}} ✅

This will:
- Always calculate "3 days ago" from the current date/time
- Work every day, automatically
- Find leads who received Email 1 at least 3 days ago

HOW TO FIX IN MAKE.COM
================================================================================

STEP 1: Open Module 1 (Google Sheets Filter Rows)
STEP 2: Find the filter for Email 1 Date (G)
STEP 3: Change the value from:
   "2025-11-21T12:16:21.072Z"
   
   To:
   {{addDays(now; -3)}}

STEP 4: Make sure the operator is "date:greater" (or "date:less" depending on logic)

STEP 5: Save

================================================================================
UNDERSTANDING THE LOGIC
================================================================================

If you want to find leads who received Email 1 AT LEAST 3 days ago:

Option A: Email 1 Date < (now - 3 days)
- Operator: date:less
- Value: {{addDays(now; -3)}}
- Meaning: Email 1 Date is older than 3 days ago

Option B: Email 1 Date > (now - 3 days)  
- Operator: date:greater
- Value: {{addDays(now; -3)}}
- Meaning: Email 1 Date is more recent than 3 days ago (WRONG for your use case!)

For your use case (find leads who got Email 1 at least 3 days ago):
- Use: date:less
- Value: {{addDays(now; -3)}}

OR

- Use: date:lessThanOrEqual  
- Value: {{addDays(now; -3)}}

This finds all dates that are 3 days old or older.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED FILTER CONFIGURATION
================================================================================

Filter 1:
- Column: E (Status)
- Operator: text:equal
- Value: "Email 1 Sent"

Filter 2:
- Column: G (Email 1 Date)
- Operator: date:less (or date:lessThanOrEqual)
- Value: {{addDays(now; -3)}}

This will find:
- All leads with Status = "Email 1 Sent"
- AND Email 1 Date is at least 3 days old

================================================================================
TESTING
================================================================================

After fixing:

1. The filter should work every day
2. It will automatically find leads ready for Email 2
3. No need to update the date manually
4. Test with a lead that has Email 1 Date = 3+ days ago

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE: Date Range Filter (More Precise)
================================================================================

If you want to be more precise (exactly 3 days, not "3 days or more"):

Filter 2a: Email 1 Date >= (now - 4 days)
Filter 2b: Email 1 Date <= (now - 3 days)

This finds leads where Email 1 was sent between 3-4 days ago.

But for your use case, "at least 3 days ago" is probably fine.
