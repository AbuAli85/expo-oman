FINAL SOLUTION: Date Filter Workaround
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
--------
Make.com keeps saving the date as hardcoded: "2025-11-21T13:43:32.928Z"
Even when you enter {{addDays(now; -3)}}, it evaluates and saves the result.

This won't work because:
- It only works until Nov 21, 2025
- After that, it stops finding leads
- It's not dynamic

================================================================================
SOLUTION: Use Date/Time Module First
================================================================================

Since Make.com won't keep the expression dynamic in the filter, calculate it separately:

STEP 1: Add Date/Time Module
-----------------------------
1. Add a NEW module BEFORE your Google Sheets Filter Rows module
2. Module type: Date/Time → Set Variable
3. Variable name: threeDaysAgo
4. Value: {{addDays(now; -3)}}
5. Save

STEP 2: Update Filter to Use Variable
--------------------------------------
1. Open Module 1 (Google Sheets Filter Rows) - now it's Module 2
2. Find Filter 2 (Email 1 Date)
3. Delete the hardcoded date: "2025-11-21T13:43:32.928Z"
4. Click expression button
5. Enter: {{threeDaysAgo}} (reference the variable from Step 1)
6. Save

This way, the date is calculated dynamically each time the scenario runs!

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE: Remove Date Filter for Testing
================================================================================

If you want to test the rest of the scenario first:

1. Remove Filter 2 (date filter) completely
2. Keep only Filter 1: Status = "Email 1 Sent"
3. This will find ALL leads with that status
4. Test that emails send and Google Sheets updates work
5. Add date filtering back later using the Date/Time module method

================================================================================
YOUR CURRENT SITUATION
================================================================================

Your filter shows:
- Date: "2025-11-21T13:43:32.928Z" (hardcoded)
- Your lead's Email 1 Date: 2025-11-20T12:47:31.395Z (Nov 20)

Since Nov 20 < Nov 21, it SHOULD match right now.
But after Nov 21 passes, it won't work anymore!

That's why you need the dynamic solution.

================================================================================
STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

1. Add Date/Time → Set Variable module
   - Name: threeDaysAgo
   - Value: {{addDays(now; -3)}}

2. Update Google Sheets filter
   - Filter 2 value: {{threeDaysAgo}}
   - Operator: time:less (keep as is)
   - Field Type: date (keep as is)

3. Save and test

4. The date will now be calculated fresh each time!

================================================================================
FOR PRODUCTION
================================================================================

Once this works:

1. The date will always be "3 days ago" from whenever the scenario runs
2. It will work every day automatically
3. No need to manually update dates
4. Add Schedule trigger: Run daily at 9:00 AM

================================================================================
TESTING
================================================================================

After implementing:

1. Run scenario manually
2. Check execution log
3. The threeDaysAgo variable should show today's date minus 3 days
4. The filter should find leads with Email 1 Date older than that
5. Emails should send correctly
