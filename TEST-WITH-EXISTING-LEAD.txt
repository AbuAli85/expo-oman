1. Open "Email 2 - Reminder" scenario in Make.com
2. Go to Module 1 (Google Sheets Filter Rows)
3. Find the date filter (Email 1 Date)
4. Temporarily change from:
   {{addDays(now; -3)}}
   
   To:
   {{addDays(now; -1)}}  (1 day instead of 3 days)
   
   OR even shorter:
   {{addHours(now; -1)}}  (1 hour instead of 3 days)

5. Save the scenario
6. Run "Email 2 - Reminder" scenario manually
7. It should find this lead and send Email 2
8. After testing, change filter back to {{addDays(now; -3)}}

================================================================================
OPTION 2: Change Lead Date Manually
================================================================================

To test with the current filter (3 days):

1. Open Google Sheets
2. Find the row for Fahad Alamri
3. Change Email 1 Date to: 4 days ago
   - If today is Dec 4, change to Nov 30
   - Or any date that's at least 3 days old

3. Email Address:
   - Verify: chairman@falconeyegroup.net is correct
   - Check spam folder

4. Resend Connection:
   - Make sure Resend is connected
   - Check if there are any API errors

================================================================================

1. The lead should now have:
   - Status: "Email 2 Sent"
   - Email 2 Date: (today's timestamp)

2. To test Email 3 immediately:
