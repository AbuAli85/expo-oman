FINAL FIX: Replace Hardcoded Date with Dynamic Calculation
================================================================================

CURRENT PROBLEM:
----------------
Your filter uses a hardcoded date:
"2025-11-21T12:19:39.543Z"

This will stop working after that date passes!

SOLUTION:
---------
Replace with dynamic date calculation that always calculates "3 days ago"

================================================================================
CORRECT FILTER CONFIGURATION
================================================================================

Filter 1:
- Column: E (Status)
- Operator: text:equal
- Value: "Email 1 Sent"

Filter 2:
- Column: G (Email 1 Date)
- Operator: time:less (or date:less)
- Value: {{addDays(now; -3)}}

CHANGE THIS:
------------
OLD: "b": "2025-11-21T12:19:39.543Z"
NEW: "b": "{{addDays(now; -3)}}"

Also change operator from "time:greater" to "time:less" (or "date:less")

Why "less"?
-----------
If Email 1 Date is LESS than (now - 3 days), it means the email was sent MORE than 3 days ago.

Example:
- Today: Dec 4, 2025
- 3 days ago: Dec 1, 2025
- Email 1 Date: Nov 30, 2025 (4 days ago)
- Is Nov 30 < Dec 1? YES ✅ (Email was sent more than 3 days ago)

STEP-BY-STEP FIX IN MAKE.COM
================================================================================

STEP 1: Open Module 1 (Google Sheets Search/Filter Rows)
STEP 2: Find Filter 2 (Email 1 Date filter)
STEP 3: Change the "b" (value) field:
   FROM: "2025-11-21T12:19:39.543Z"
   TO: {{addDays(now; -3)}}

STEP 4: Change the operator if needed:
   FROM: "time:greater"
   TO: "time:less" (or "date:less")

STEP 5: Save the module
STEP 6: Test the scenario

{

        [
            {
                "a": "E",
                "b": "Email 1 Sent",
                "o": "text:equal"
            },
            {
                "a": "G",
                "b": "{{addDays(now; -3)}}",
                "o": "time:less"
            }
        ]

    "spreadsheetId": "1cv2JYytpapLB24UsvPsHAtoYyu2vaIQA1pZGhNWjfyQ",
    "tableFirstRow": "A1:CZ1",
    "includesHeaders": true,
    "valueRenderOption": "FORMATTED_VALUE",
    "dateTimeRenderOption": "FORMATTED_STRING"
}

KEY CHANGES:
------------
1. "b": "2025-11-21T12:19:39.543Z" → "b": "{{addDays(now; -3)}}"
2. "o": "time:greater" → "o": "time:less"

================================================================================
WHY "time:less" INSTEAD OF "time:greater"?
================================================================================

You want to find leads where Email 1 was sent AT LEAST 3 days ago.

This means: Email 1 Date < (now - 3 days)

Example:
- Now: Dec 4, 2025, 12:00 PM
- 3 days ago: Dec 1, 2025, 12:00 PM
- Email 1 Date: Nov 30, 2025 (4 days ago)

Check: Is Nov 30 < Dec 1? YES ✅
Result: This lead should receive Email 2 ✅

If you use "time:greater":
- Check: Is Nov 30 > Dec 1? NO ❌
- Result: Lead won't be found ❌

So use "time:less" to find dates OLDER than 3 days ago.

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE OPERATORS
================================================================================

If "time:less" doesn't work, try:
- "date:less"
- "date:lessThanOrEqual"
- "time:lessThanOrEqual"

All of these will find dates that are 3+ days old.

================================================================================
TESTING
================================================================================

After fixing:

1. The filter will work every day automatically
2. It will find leads where Email 1 Date is at least 3 days old
3. No need to manually update dates
4. Test with a lead that has Email 1 Date = 3+ days ago

================================================================================
FOR EMAIL 3 SCENARIO
================================================================================

When you create Email 3, use the same approach:

Filter 1: Status (E) = "Email 2 Sent"
Filter 2: Email 2 Date (H) < {{addDays(now; -4)}}

This finds leads who received Email 2 at least 4 days ago.
