FIX: Google Sheets Filter Finding 0 Rows
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
--------
rowCount = 0 means the Google Sheets filter isn't finding any matching rows.
This is why all columns are null - there's no data to access!

Your filters:
1. Status (E) = "Email 1 Sent"
2. Email 1 Date (G) < {{threeDaysAgo}} (from Date/Time module)

================================================================================
POSSIBLE CAUSES
================================================================================

CAUSE 1: Date Filter Not Working
---------------------------------
The {{threeDaysAgo}} variable might not be working in the filter.
Or the date comparison isn't matching.

Your lead has:
- Email 1 Date: 2025-11-20T12:47:31.395Z (Nov 20)
- threeDaysAgo should be: Nov 21 or later (if today is Nov 24+)

If threeDaysAgo is Nov 21, and Email 1 Date is Nov 20:
- Nov 20 < Nov 21? YES ✅ Should match!

But if the date format doesn't match, it won't work.

CAUSE 2: Status Value Mismatch
-------------------------------
The Status column might not be exactly "Email 1 Sent"
- Could be "Email 1 Sent " (with trailing space)
- Could be "email 1 sent" (different case)
- Could be something else entirely

CAUSE 3: Date Variable Not Resolving
------------------------------------
The {{threeDaysAgo}} variable might not be accessible in the filter.
Make.com filters might not support variables from other modules.

================================================================================
SOLUTION: Test Filters Separately
================================================================================

STEP 1: Test Status Filter Only
---------------------------------
1. Remove the date filter (Filter 2) temporarily
2. Keep only: Status (E) = "Email 1 Sent"
3. Run scenario
4. Check rowCount

If rowCount > 0 → Status filter works, date filter is the problem
If rowCount = 0 → Status filter is the problem

STEP 2: Test Date Filter Only
------------------------------
1. Remove Status filter (Filter 1) temporarily
2. Keep only: Email 1 Date (G) < {{threeDaysAgo}}
3. Run scenario
4. Check rowCount

If rowCount > 0 → Date filter works, status filter is the problem
If rowCount = 0 → Date filter is the problem

STEP 3: Check Actual Values
----------------------------
1. Add variables to see actual values:
   - testStatus = Check Google Sheets directly
   - testEmail1Date = Check Google Sheets directly
   - testThreeDaysAgo = {{threeDaysAgo}}

2. Compare to see what's different

================================================================================
MOST LIKELY ISSUE: Date Variable in Filter
================================================================================

Make.com filters might not support variables from other modules directly.
The {{threeDaysAgo}} variable might not be accessible in the filter.

SOLUTION: Use Expression in Filter
-----------------------------------
Instead of using the variable, try calculating directly in the filter:

1. In the date filter, instead of: {{threeDaysAgo}}
2. Try: {{addDays(now; -3)}}
3. Or try: {{sub(now; 259200)}} (3 days in seconds)

But we know Make.com evaluates this and saves it as hardcoded...

ALTERNATIVE: Remove Date Filter for Now
---------------------------------------
1. Remove the date filter completely
2. Keep only: Status = "Email 1 Sent"
3. This will find ALL leads with that status
4. Test that the rest works (emails, Google Sheets updates)
5. Add date filtering back later using a different approach

================================================================================
QUICK FIX: Test Without Date Filter
================================================================================

1. Open Module 2 (Google Sheets Search Rows)
2. Remove Filter 2 (date filter) completely
3. Keep only Filter 1: Status (E) = "Email 1 Sent"
4. Save
5. Run scenario
6. Check rowCount

If rowCount > 0 now:
- The date filter was the problem
- You can test the rest of the scenario
- Fix date filtering later

If rowCount still = 0:
- The Status filter is the problem
- Check the exact value in Google Sheets

================================================================================
CHECK YOUR DATA
================================================================================

Verify in Google Sheets:
- Status column (E): Should be exactly "Email 1 Sent" (no spaces, correct case)
- Email 1 Date (G): Should be a valid date (2025-11-20T12:47:31.395Z)
- Make sure there are no formatting issues

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE: Use Filter Module Instead
================================================================================

Instead of filtering in Google Sheets:

1. Get ALL rows with Status = "Email 1 Sent" (no date filter)
2. Add a Filter module after Google Sheets
3. Filter by date there: Email 1 Date < {{threeDaysAgo}}
4. This gives you more control and better debugging
