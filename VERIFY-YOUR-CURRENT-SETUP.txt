VERIFY YOUR CURRENT EMAIL 1 SETUP
Based on What You Showed Me
================================================================================

I can see your Module 3 configuration. Let me verify what's correct and what needs fixing.

================================================================================
WHAT YOU SHOWED ME
================================================================================

TO FIELD:
---------
Shows: {"value": "8. email"}

This looks correct! In Make.com UI, "8. email" is the label for {{8.email}}.
The actual value used is {{8.email}}.

✅ This should work!

SUBJECT:
--------
Shows: "8. name,You're Invited..."

ISSUE: Missing curly braces and space after comma.

Should be: "{{8.name}}, You're Invited..."

HTML:
-----
Shows: "Dear {{8.name}},"

✅ This is correct!

================================================================================
VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

CHECK 1: TO FIELD
-----------------
Your "To" field shows: {"value": "8. email"}

In Make.com UI, this is correct! The label "8. email" represents {{8.email}}.

VERIFY:
-------
1. Click on the "To" field
2. Click on the object item
3. Check the "value" field
4. It should show: {{8.email}} (with curly braces)
5. If it shows just "8. email" (label), that's fine - it's correct

✅ If it shows {{8.email}} or "8. email" → CORRECT!

CHECK 2: SUBJECT LINE
---------------------
Your subject shows: "8. name,You're Invited..."

FIX NEEDED:
-----------
Should be: "{{8.name}}, You're Invited..."

HOW TO FIX:
-----------
1. Open Module 3
2. Subject field
3. Change: "8. name,You're Invited..."
4. To: "{{8.name}}, You're Invited..."
5. Save

CHECK 3: HTML CONTENT
---------------------
Your HTML shows: "Dear {{8.name}},"

✅ This is CORRECT!

================================================================================
FINAL VERIFICATION
================================================================================

TO FIELD:
---------
Current: {"value": "8. email"}
Status: ✅ Should work (Make.com uses label, but value is {{8.email}})

To be 100% sure:
1. Click on "To" field
2. Click on the object
3. Check "value" field
4. Should show: {{8.email}} or "8. email" (both are fine)

SUBJECT:
--------
Current: "8. name,You're Invited..."
Status: ⚠️ Needs fixing

Fix to: "{{8.name}}, You're Invited..."

HTML:
-----
Current: "Dear {{8.name}},"
Status: ✅ CORRECT!

================================================================================
QUICK FIX NEEDED
================================================================================

ONLY ONE FIX:
-------------
Subject line needs fixing:

1. Open Module 3
2. Subject field
3. Change from: "8. name,You're Invited..."
4. Change to: "{{8.name}}, You're Invited..."
   (Add curly braces and space after comma)
5. Save

Do the same for Module 4 (Arabic Email) subject.

================================================================================
TEST AFTER FIXING
================================================================================

1. Fix subject line in Module 3
2. Fix subject line in Module 4
3. Save scenario
4. Make sure scenario is ON
5. Add test lead to Google Sheets
6. Wait 15 seconds
7. Check:
   □ Execution appears
   □ Email sent
   □ Subject shows: "fahad alamri, You're Invited..." (with name)
   □ Email body shows: "Dear fahad alamri,"

================================================================================
IF TO FIELD STILL NOT WORKING
================================================================================

If emails still don't send after fixing subject:

1. Click on "To" field in Module 3
2. Click on the object item
3. Check "value" field
4. If it shows "8. email" (label), click on it
5. Make sure it maps to {{8.email}} (with curly braces)
6. If not, manually type: {{8.email}}
7. Save

The format should be:
[{"value": "{{8.email}}"}]

In Make.com UI, it might show as:
[{"value": "8. email"}]

But internally it should resolve to {{8.email}}.

================================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================================

YOUR CONFIGURATION:
-------------------
✅ To field: Looks correct ({"value": "8. email"})
⚠️ Subject: Needs fixing (add {{}} and space)
✅ HTML: Correct ({{8.name}})

FIX NEEDED:
-----------
Subject line: Change "8. name," to "{{8.name}}, " (add curly braces and space)

After this fix, everything should work! 🎉
